UNFORGIVEN is my first serious gamedev project. 

I plan to use it as part of the portfolio or CV. It would be cool to release it on Itch.io someday
Project is fully made in GDScript and all art is made in pixilart.com. Even though Aseprite is within my reach, I decided to just finish Unforgiven in pixel art website. Just for lulz.

I post updates here when I have time and will to code something (rare event)
